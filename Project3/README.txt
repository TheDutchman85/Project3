This web application was made for Rich Media Web App Dev 1's project 3.  In it I use two API's and javascript to create an expierence
for the player.  This program has the following:

-index.html                 To host the html elements for the web
-styles:
    -default-styles.css     To add css styles to my program
-src:
    -ajax.js		    To load in the required api files.
    -classes.js             To set up markers for the map.
    -loader.js              To load in the main.js and keep the code more secure by being the only linked one in the index.html.
    -main.js                Hosts the core javascript as well as links all the other .js's files together.
    -map.js                 To handle the making of the map through the mapbox api.

WHAT WENT RIGHT:
I had a lot of fun making this application.  I was able to work on this project with little to no setbacks.  I also think I did a great job on the interactivity of the whole thing
and I though I made it look noce too.  

WHAT WENT WRONG:
My original plan had me using certain api's to help me show my clients what I wanted to show them.  After further inspection I found that these API's did not have what I was looking
for so I chose to make my own api.  This was hard to do at first but I soon got the hang of it.  After making the project I found it really hard to add search options for my project.
it was hard because my application was not set up in a way that supported search fetures.  It was more of an exploring map.  So following the guidlines was a bit tough.

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD:
Since I made my own API I would love to add more entries to it to make the search even larger than before.  Also I would love to add a picture from each location.  

HOW TO PLAY:
The application is quite simple.  You can look around the map using the controls described below to view all of my favorite locations and then add them to your favorites.  Its
an exploration application.

CONTROLS: 
The controls for this game are very simple.  Left click on a map marker to show the information it holds.  When this pops up you can then hit the favorite button at the bottom
of the popup to add this location/ city to your favorites list.  Once there you can actually click on the name and it will bring you to it on the map.  As for the map navigation
hold down left click to drag the map, hold right click to adjust the angle of the map, and use the scroll wheel to zoom.  These features are also on the top tight corner of the
screen. There is a plus to zoom in and a minus to zoom out.  Below those are a third control to change the angle by mouse movment.  Next to those three are two buttons, one is
to reset the zoom, back to the original zoom, the other is to reset the view, back tothe original viewing angle. The final button is a reset favorites which will clear out the 
favorites list and local storage as well as resets the UI.  With all of these are two checkboxs.  These give the user an option to what they want to see.  They can either both be
checked or one can be.

CITATION:
In this program there are methods and functions that were inspired by/ used from IGM's Rich Media and Web Dev 1 class taught by Prof Jefferson.  These methods can be found across
all the .js files.  These files, for the most part, have been changed or manipulated in a way that makes them more unique to my program. I also used tutorial from this class to help aid my progress.

MY GRADE/ self critique:
I would realisticly grade myself a 95% for this project.  I thought I did a great job of using two api's and displaying the data to my users in a fun easy way.  The only thing that 
really concerns me and my grade is that my personal API is not up to standards or good enough.  I personaly think I hit every checkbox with it but since it is my first one I have ever made
I have my concerns.

Thank you for reading and enjoy my game.
